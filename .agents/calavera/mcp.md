# Calavera MCP Setup

Register the Calavera MCP server from the project root using this project's package manager (npm):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "calavera": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--package", "create-project-calavera@2.1.0", "create-project-calavera-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Project-scoped MCP servers run with the project root as their working directory.
Using the package manager declared by the project avoids package-manager
preflight failures before Calavera can start, such as npm rejecting a Bun-managed
project through `devEngines.packageManager`.

When configuring an MCP server manually, choose the command that matches the
project's package manager. Put the first word in the MCP `command` field and
the remaining words in `args`:

- npm: `npx --package create-project-calavera@2.1.0 create-project-calavera-mcp`
- pnpm: `pnpm dlx --package create-project-calavera@2.1.0 create-project-calavera-mcp`
- Yarn: `yarn dlx --package create-project-calavera@2.1.0 create-project-calavera-mcp`
- Bun: `bunx --package create-project-calavera@2.1.0 create-project-calavera-mcp`

If your agent exposes an MCP setup UI or config writer, use the snippet above.
If the agent needs approval before editing its own config, ask first.

## Bun temp and cache directories

If a Bun-based MCP launch fails before Calavera starts with
`error: bun is unable to write files to tempdir: PermissionDenied`, configure
the MCP host to give that server a writable temp directory. Set `TMPDIR` to an
absolute path that exists and is writable by the MCP host process, such as an
absolute path to a project-local `.calavera/tmp` directory.

If Bun can write temp files but cannot populate its package cache, also set
`BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR` to an absolute writable directory, such as an absolute
path to `.calavera/bun-install-cache`. Keep these environment overrides on Bun
MCP registrations only; they are recovery settings for restricted hosts, not
part of the default Calavera MCP config.

## Claude Code

For Claude Code, prefer a project-scoped `.mcp.json` in the project root when
the team should share the Calavera server registration. Use the same package
manager-specific snippet above.

Do not put this server registration in `.claude/settings.json`; Claude Code
does not load MCP servers from that file. You can also register the same command
with `claude mcp add` if you want Claude Code to manage the entry.

Registering this MCP server is a persistent code-execution change because it
runs `npx --package create-project-calavera@2.1.0 create-project-calavera-mcp`. Ask for explicit user approval before creating
`.mcp.json`, running `claude mcp add`, or approving the first server launch.

Use the tools in this order:

1. `inspect_project`
2. `list_profiles`
3. `list_integrations`
4. `describe_integration`
5. `list_ai_artifacts`
6. `compose_recipe`
7. `validate_recipe`
8. `explain_recipe`
9. `dry_run_apply`
10. `apply_recipe`

`dry_run_apply` is the review boundary. Show its inspection findings, omitted
script explanations, ownership notes, and planned file changes to the user, then
wait for explicit approval before calling `apply_recipe`.

If the MCP transport closes or reports `-32000` during or immediately after
`apply_recipe`, treat the apply outcome as unknown instead of failed. Inspect
`calavera.config.json`, `.calavera/state.json`, generated files, and package
metadata before retrying the apply.

## Formatter choice

Choose one formatter per project. Do not combine Oxfmt and Prettier in one
recipe; they would compete for the same formatting scripts and config ownership.

Before composing a recipe, call `inspect_project` or inspect the project for existing tooling files such as `package.json`, `calavera.config.json`, `.editorconfig`, `eslint.config.js`, `oxlint.json`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.stylelintrc.json`, and `tsconfig.json`. Mention likely conflicts or local conventions before proposing changes. If conflicts exist, say whether they are hard stops or migration decisions, then use `dry_run_apply` to show the impact when adoption is still possible.

If the MCP server cannot be registered, use the hosted Web UI to compose and download a recipe:

https://calavera.schalkneethling.com

Then run `npm create project-calavera apply -- --dry-run` and ask for approval before running `npm create project-calavera apply`.

Suggested first prompt:

> Use Calavera for this project. Inspect the current project for existing tooling and possible config conflicts, then list the available profiles, integrations, and AI artifacts. Once the profile and requirements are clear, compose a recipe, show me the dry-run result, and apply it only after I approve.
